# <h>  **Job Recommendation model with advanced analytics using Web Scrapping, Python, Power Query, MS Excel and MS PowerPoint.**

**Developed a web-based recommendation model using machine learning to provide personalized job suggestions based on user skill sets and preferences. The model was trained in Jupyter Notebook, leveraging Scikit-Learn, NumPy, and Pandas for data processing and modeling. The implementation was done using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface. The web application, designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enables users to explore relevant job openings, ideal experience levels, suitable departments, and compatible company culture, all tailored to their unique skill set and requirements.**

1  **Build Pipeline**: In order to take this project to the next level we can create a kind of pipeline in which the scrapped data automatically clean, load into the mysql , power bi and build the model without human intervention. 

2  **Real-time Data Updates**: Implement a scheduled data scraping process to keep the MySQL database updated with the latest job data. This way, the dashboard in Power BI and machine learning aligorithm can reflect real-time insights, allowing users to stay up-to-date with the evolving political landscape.

3  **Multi-Platform Deployment**: Extend the project's reach by deploying the interactive dashboard & model  on various platforms, such as web applications or mobile apps, to make it accessible to a broader audience.
